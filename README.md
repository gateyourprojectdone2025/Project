## 1. Abstract
The **Prison Management System (PMS)** is a comprehensive **web-based application** designed to automate and streamline the management of correctional facilities including prisons, jails, and detention centers.  

Traditional prison operations often rely on manual record-keeping, which can be **inefficient, error-prone, and vulnerable to security breaches**. PMS provides a **centralized, secure, and efficient platform** for managing all aspects of prison administration, ensuring **better control, transparency, and accountability**.  

The system supports **role-based access control**, with different permissions for:
- **Administrators** – Manage staff assignments, prisoner records, visitor logs, transfers, and reports.  
- **Officers** – Register new prisoners, monitor records, manage visits, and handle transfers.  

PMS maintains detailed records including:
- Prisoner information (personal details, offense, sentence, rehabilitation, transfers).  
- Staff management (officers, duties, transfer records).  
- Court details (trial dates, cases, sentencing).  
- Visitor management (schedules, security logs).  

All activities are logged for **security and auditing**, and **automated notifications** alert staff about critical events such as court hearings, parole eligibility, or prisoner movements. The system also supports **report generation and analytics** for effective decision-making.
